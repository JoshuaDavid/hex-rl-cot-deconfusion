## 2026-08-05 01:10 — Session start, Phase 0

- Environment: A100-PCIE-40GB (single), torch 2.13.0+cu130, 150G free disk. Driver CUDA 13.0.
- Plan: follow RESEARCH_AGENDA.md protocol loop. Phase 0 today (CPU): benzene solver build (delegated to background agent per user suggestion), hex env + ASCII renderer + ~20 solver games read by hand, token arithmetic.
- Decision: match benzene's conventions exactly in my Python env (Black connects top↔bottom, White left↔right, cells like `c3`) so solver interop is trivial and un-confusing.
- Registered predictions carried over from agenda (odds re-anchored after Phase 1, before Phase 2).

## 2026-08-05 01:35 — Token arithmetic + core framing decision

- Board renders: 5x5=72 tok, 7x7=114, 9x9=164. Per-turn prompt ~300 tok + CoT 512-1024. Cheap.
- **Decision: single-turn RL framing.** Each training sample = one position (full board in prompt), model emits CoT + move, reward = solver verdict. GRPO group = 8 rollouts of the same position. No multi-turn machinery needed in verl.
  - Training positions restricted to *positions winning for the player to move* (a win-preserving move always exists): reward +1 keep-win, -1 throw-win, -1 illegal/format-fail. Lost positions give zero within-group variance (all moves lose) => no gradient => excluded.
  - Position distribution: seed corpus from randomized solver games; refresh periodically with self-play games from current policy (scored offline by solver) to keep distribution on-policy-ish.
  - Caveat logged: this optimizes "find win-preserving move on our position distribution," not full-game play directly. Eval (transfer, optimality) uses solver-labeled fixed position sets, per agenda.
- Background: vllm installing into /venv/main; Qwen3-1.7B/0.6B downloading; verl-setup agent building /venv/verl; benzene build agent running.

## 2026-08-05 02:05 — Phase 0 substantially complete

Looked at: benzene build report, solver latency, 8 full 5x5 games + 5 6x6 games (read game 0 move-by-move; final chain verified by eye), corpus stats.

- Benzene built clean (agent, zero patches). Binary: benzene-vanilla-cmake/build/src/mohex/mohex. Solver GTP: dfpn-solve-state, dfpn-solver-find-winning. Empty-board sanity: 5x5/6x6/7x7/8x8 all first-player wins; 7x7 winning opening set matches published results.
- Latency: 5x5/6x6 per-move find-winning ~10-50ms warm. 7x7 find-winning cold on empty board ~64s; single solve-state ~1s. 8x8 empty solve ~43s.
- **Design: solver-free RL loop.** Corpus build precomputes the full winning-move set per position => training reward = set membership lookup. Solver cost is all offline. (move_keeps_win single-child-solve kept as fallback for policy-generated positions later.)
- Corpora: 904 5x5 (14s) + 929 6x6 (108s) positions labeled. 73-77% winning-for-mover (usable for RL). p(random legal move preserves win) ~0.3 mean => GRPO groups will have reward variance at cold start. Deeper positions are harder (p_rand ~0.19 at 16 stones on 5x5, vs 0.36 at 2 stones).
- 7x7 corpus/games: generation running, slow at low stone counts as expected. May restrict 7x7 training positions to >=4 stones, or accept slow one-time build.
- C4 KL-arm decision (provisional): use stock verl fixed-beta KL(pi||ref) in the RL objective as the "halfhearted preservation" condition, NOT the replay-distillation variant from the agenda — it's what practitioners actually do, and needs no custom trainer. Revisit when verl agent reports.
- Still confusing: nothing yet. Waiting on: vllm install (slow, network-bound), verl env agent, 7x7 games.

## 2026-08-05 02:50 — SURPRISE: benzene find-winning is not an exact winning-move oracle

Looked at: 7x7 game 1 move-by-move (per the read-your-data rule). Ply 17: B had just played a winning move at ply 15, yet solver reported 0/33 winning moves for B — impossible.

Diagnosis (confirmed in benzene source, DfpnCommands.cpp CmdFindWinning + EndgameUtil):
1. `dfpn-solver-find-winning` first runs ComputeAll (ICE fill-in). On positions the VC engine already *determines*, fill-in occupies every empty cell => the command iterates over nothing and returns [] EVEN WHEN THE POSITION IS WON. (Empirically: solve-state=black, find-winning=[], get-pv=[], zero "Trying" log lines, elapsed 2e-6s.)
2. On non-determined positions, it only tests moves in the ICE consider set => winning-but-inferior (dominated/captured) moves are silently omitted.

Consequences caught before they poisoned anything:
- My v1 corpora (and gen_games n_winning fields) had (a) determined-win positions mislabeled as losses, (b) incomplete winning sets that would punish genuinely winning moves with -1 reward.
- Monotonicity check verified: on the determined-win position, 8/8 spot-checked arbitrary moves still B-win (extra stones never hurt you in hex).

Fix: HexSolver.exact_winning_moves = exhaustive per-child solve-state + assert(parent winner consistent with children). Exact by construction; consistency check runs on every corpus position. Cost fine: 7x7 worst ~15s at 2 stones, <5s at 6+, trivial deep; TT sharing across siblings helps a lot. All corpora being rebuilt.

Still confusing: nothing — mechanism fully explained. Meta-lesson logged: the agenda's "read every sample" rule caught this within the first 20 games. Trophy for eyes-on-data.

## 2026-08-05 03:30 — RAM incident + env mutation incident

- User reported box struggling. Causes: (1) 40 mohex workers x ~770MB+ default DFPN TT (swap fully consumed at some point); (2) background `uv pip install vllm` mutated /venv/main mid-run and REMOVED accelerate, crashing the comprehension eval at import time.
- Fixes: HexSolver now sets param_dfpn tt_size 524288 (~200MB/proc); corpus workers 40->20; killed the uv retry loop (pypi network degraded to ~50KB/s anyway — vllm deferred, Phase 1 runs on plain transformers batched generation).
- Lesson (feedback-to-self): never run package installs into an env that concurrently serves running jobs. verl agent uses isolated /venv/verl, unaffected.
- Corpora v2 (exact labels): 5x5 = 1214 pos (10s), 6x6 = 1231 pos (34s). 7x7 rebuilding.

## 2026-08-05 02:25 — Exact corpora v2 + comprehension first read

- Exact labels vs old find-winning labels: p(random move wins) 0.28 -> 0.42 on 5x5. The buggy oracle was silently marking ~1/7 of winning moves as losses. Reward would have been meaningfully noisy.
- 17-21% of winning positions are fully-determined (ALL moves win). Excluded from RL training (zero GRPO advantage), kept for eval.
- B/W among winning-for-mover: ~40/60 after adding odd stone buckets. Both sides represented.
- Comprehension (provisional, truncation-contaminated run, robust regrade): lookup 0.90, connected 0.87, adjacent 0.67, neighbors 0.60, TOTAL 0.76. Errors mostly = ran out of thinking budget mid-derivation, not conceptual confusion. The 50/50 plan-killer (P1.2) is trending PASS. Clean rerun with 3584-token budget in flight.
- Infra: pypi CDN (fastly) degraded ~20-50KB/s; download.pytorch.org 825KB/s; aliyun pypi mirror ~350KB/s. vllm install deferred until GPU jobs pause (learned: uv mutates env mid-install; it removed accelerate under a running job).

## 2026-08-05 03:05 — Phase 1 results (items 2, 3 done; 1 pending rerun)

Looked at: clean comprehension run (120 Q, 11 truncated), all 8 quiz answers in full, several full CoTs.

- **P1.2 board comprehension: PASS.** lookup 0.93, neighbors 0.93, adjacent 0.87, connected 0.83, TOTAL 0.89 (robust regrade; in-script grader was broken, kept regrade path). Registered 50% -> resolved YES. CoT style: methodical coordinate arithmetic using the prompt's neighbor formula; no spatial-gestalt shortcuts observed.
- **P1.3 contamination quiz: essentially ZERO hex theory.** Bridge: wrong (thinks edge-to-edge chain). Perfect-play winner: wrong (claims 2nd player wins; no strategy-stealing argument). Ladder, edge template, virtual connection: admits unfamiliarity. Swap rule: garbled (cites chess 1.e4). Corners: confuses board corners with hexagon tile angles. Registered 30% "already verbalizes bridge-like concepts" -> resolved NO. Invention-purity precondition holds. Caveat for C2: the *words* bridge/ladder exist in the model's English; track hex-*meaning* emergence, not surface tokens.
- P1.1 legal-move rate: first run unusable (GPU OOM degraded generation -> 92% truncation). Rerun queued on vllm.
- Infra: vllm installing into isolated /venv/vllm via aliyun mirror (~350KB/s). HF-generate backend has KV-cache OOM issues at batch 16 x 3584 tok; batch 8 works but slow. All remaining GPU evals wait for vllm.

## 2026-08-05 03:20 — Pre-pilot design notes (informed by Phase 1 samples)

- Qwen3-1.7B thinks LONG on hex prompts (median ~1.5k tok; 32% truncation at 2048). Pilot config: max_response 3072, batch ~24-32 positions x 8 rollouts. Truncated rollout => no parsed move => -1: implicit but real pressure toward shorter thinking. Watch length drift as a first-class observable (C3-relevant: does RL compress the CoT?).
- Keep stock GRPO (verl defaults, incl. std-normalized advantage). No length shaping, no format shaping beyond the -1. Reward stays pure win/lose/illegal. Rationale: the research question is "what does vanilla RL do", not "what does my clever reward do".
- Health metrics per step: frac groups all-fail (no gradient), frac all-win (no gradient), mean response len, entropy.
- Learned (ops): container PID limit 2816; Ray smoke test ~2.6k pids. Don't stack corpus builds/GPU evals during verl runs. Invoke /venv/main/bin/python explicitly (session PATH now led by an unrelated venv).

## 2026-08-05 03:40 — C2 miner built + null-calibration lesson

- mine_vocab.py written; first null run (stride-split of comprehension CoTs) showed huge fake enrichments — stride-2 split anti-correlated with question-type periodicity. Lesson: C2 comparisons are only valid PROMPT-MATCHED (same position set, both corpora). Plan: per-position sample-split null using movequality k=8 data.
- C3 probe design written to notes/design_probes.md (validation-tier features first, per Karvonen).

## 2026-08-05 04:15 — Phase 1 items 4+5: the thinking-length problem

Looked at: 200 think-mode + 200 no-think move samples (25 positions x k=8, temp 1.0).

- **Think mode at temp 1.0: 200/200 truncated at 3584 tokens.** Median length hits the cap; CoTs meander (endless neighbor recomputation). Comprehension at temp 0.6 truncated only ~9% — temperature drives thinking length hard. Direct GRPO consequence: temp-1.0 rollouts would be ~all-truncated => all -1 => zero group variance => no learning. Pilot config MUST resolve this. Options: lower rollout temp (0.7-0.85), bigger budget (4096-6144), brevity prompt. Sweep queued for vllm.
- **No-think: legal 0.695; win rate 0.350 overall; among-legal win rate 0.504 vs random 0.341.** Base model has weak but real move judgment without CoT. Group variance present (11/25 groups) => GRPO has cold-start signal even in worst case.
- P1.4 (think/no_think gap): unmeasurable at temp 1.0 (think never finishes); re-measure at temp 0.6. P1.5 (group variance): PASS (via no-think; think pending temp fix).
- P1.1 legal rate: no-think 0.695 < 90% gate — but most parse failures at temp 1.0 may be format flubs; recheck at 0.6 with the sweep. Not yet a fail.
- Note the pleasing irony: the config-killer (truncation) is itself C3-relevant evidence — thinking length is unstable at high temp, and RL pressure via the -1-on-truncation channel will push toward shorter/terminating CoTs. Track length distribution across training as a first-class curve.

## 2026-08-05 04:50 — The overthinking wall, quantified

- vllm sweep on move prompts (30 pos x k=8): temp 0.6 => 100% truncation at 3584 tok, 93% at 6144. Confirmed NOT a repetition loop by reading start/middle/end of a long CoT: coherent candidate-move deliberation that never converges. (Also spotted a board-reasoning error: called b3/b5 "adjacent".)
- Contrast: factual comprehension questions at same temp truncate ~9%. It's the open-ended decision that unbounds the rumination.
- Interpretation: Qwen3-1.7B lacks a decisiveness policy for this task. RL will have to (and, via the -1 unparsed channel, will be pressured to) *create termination behavior* — itself a C1-flavored question: is "decide and stop" in the base model's support?
- Action: testing prompt variants (plain / brief-250-words / at-most-3-candidates) x temp {0.7, 1.0} at 3072. Whatever variant we pick becomes THE task prompt everywhere (base evals, RL, pass@k) so all comparisons stay prompt-matched.
- Fallback if prompts fail: custom verl AgentLoop doing two-phase generation (think capped, force-inject "</think>\n\nMove:" continuation). Documented API in notes/verl_setup.md makes this ~50 lines.
- verl smoke test status: agent still iterating (its vllm server was my "GPU squatter" — host-PID confusion, no external tenant. We time-share the GPU; its retry loop waits for free GPU).

## 2026-08-05 05:40 — Phase 1 COMPLETE; forced-close solves the overthinking wall

- Prompt variants failed (brevity instr: 87-90% still truncate; "3 candidates" instr: 100%). Qwen3's think phase does not obey length instructions.
- **Forced-close two-phase generation works**: cap think at budget, inject "</think>\n\nMove:", generate ~8 answer tokens. Results (30 pos x 8): legal 0.83-0.89, win ~0.31, reward variance in 18-20/30 groups, at both 2048 and 3072 think budgets, temps 0.7/1.0. 0 natural closes at baseline (model never terminates on its own — "does RL teach natural termination?" becomes a trackable curve: natural_close rate per checkpoint).
- **P1.4 resolved**: forced-close CoT win 0.31 vs no-think 0.35 -> CoT NOT load-bearing at baseline. C3 reframed per agenda contingency: "does RL create load-bearing CoT where none existed?" think/no_think gap per checkpoint is the metric.
- Phase 1 verdict: PASS overall. Comprehension strong (0.89), zero hex-theory contamination, GRPO signal exists (var-groups ~2/3), legality 0.83-0.89 under forced-close (P1.1 gate satisfied under the actual rollout scheme).
- Implementation: custom verl AgentLoop (hexenv/hex_agent_loop.py, registered "hex_forced_close" via hexenv/agent_loops.yaml). Masking: model tokens 1, injected scaffold 0; natural </think> stays mask 1.
- Pilot config: think_budget 2040, response_length 2176, temp 1.0, group n=8, batch 32 positions, lr 1e-6, KL beta 1e-3 (arm A). 0.6B x 3 steps smoke first, then 1.7B x 100.

## 2026-08-05 06:20 — verl + custom agent loop: first end-to-end validation pass

- Smoke run (0.6B) executed val-before-train THROUGH the forced-close agent loop + custom reward: reward mean -0.74; kinds: win 0.13 / lose 0.58 / illegal 0.24 / unparsed 0.05. Plumbing verified: dataset -> agent loop -> two-phase generation -> reward -> metrics. (0.6B win 0.13 vs 1.7B 0.31 on similar positions: model size matters for hex judgment.)
- Crash #1 after val: KeyError 'rollout_log_probs' — my loop returned response_logprobs=None. Fixed: calculate_log_probs=True + stitch phase1/phase2 logprobs, 0.0 on injected scaffold tokens (masked anyway).
- Stopped the verl setup agent (its env+notes deliverable complete; its remaining smoke mission superseded by mine; GPU/pid contention between two autonomous processes was the dominant failure source).
- Cleanup lesson repeated: `pkill -f` matched my own wrapper shell AGAIN (memory note existed; still stepped on it). Bracket-pattern habit now: pkill -f 'name[x]'.

## 2026-08-05 06:50 — Smoke debugging round 3-4

- Round 3 reached training steps 1-2 successfully (first actual GRPO updates through the forced-close loop!). Healthy internals: entropy 0.81, rollout-vs-actor logprob diff mean 0.007 (stitched logprobs correct). Then AgentLoopWorker died: native zmq_socket crash — thread/pid ceiling again (idle floor ~910 of pids.max 2816; verl stack peaks near the rest).
- Squeezes applied: OMP 8->4, ray num_cpus 8->6, TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM=false, syncthing stopped. Round 4 running with peak-pid tracking.
- Fixes so far for custom agent loop: (1) response_logprobs stitched from both phases (scaffold tokens 0.0, masked), calculate_log_probs=True; (2) min/max_global_steps merged from both generate calls' server-stamped extra_fields.

## 2026-08-05 07:15 — SMOKE PASSED. Phase 2 plumbing complete.

- Round 5 (agent.num_workers=1, reward.num_workers=1, TQ storage_units=1, OMP=4, num_cpus=6, tokenizers-parallelism off, syncthing stopped): 3 GRPO steps + final val, exit 0. Peak pids 2156/2816 — the crash was zmq thread exhaustion; single workers give ~650 headroom.
- Total custom-agent-loop fixes: logprob stitching, min/max_global_steps merging, worker-count minimization. Rollout side channel verified (full responses + kinds logged per sample).
- Launching real pilot: Qwen3-1.7B, 100 steps, batch 32 pos x n=8, resp_len 2176 (2040 think + scaffold + 8 answer), temp 1.0, lr 1e-6, KL beta 1e-3, save every 25, val every 25. Registered predictions for the pilot:
  - Reward slope clearly positive by step 100: 70%
  - Legality (parse+legal) > 0.95 by step 100: 60% (easiest gradient available)
  - Win-rate (temp-0.6 val) > 0.45 by step 100 (from 0.31 base): 55%
  - Natural-close rate rises above 5% by step 100: 25% (fixed think budget removes most termination pressure)
  - Some degenerate CoT shortening (mean think len < 1000 tok): 30%

## 2026-08-05 07:35 — Pilot v2 launched after throughput fix

- Pilot v1 step timing 333s: gen 104 / ref 96 (CPU-offloaded!) / old_lp 27 / update 102 (micro=1). Restarted at step ~3 with ref on-GPU, actor micro 1->4, logprob micro 2->8. Expect ~3min/step, ~5h for 100 steps.
- 1.7B step-0 val (mixed 5/6/7 boards, temp 0.6, k=1): reward -0.675, win 0.162, entropy(rollout t1.0) 0.30, response len 2168 (at cap - thinking never terminates, as designed around).
- Standing monitors: per-step metrics via persistent Monitor; rollout side-channel trends via scripts/rollout_trends.py (to run periodically + read CoTs per protocol).

## 2026-08-05 08:15 — Pilot v2 first 10 steps

- Timing stable 240s/step (gen 104 / ref 28 / old_lp 22 / update 82). ETA ~6.5h for 100 steps.
- Train reward (t=1.0): -0.80 -> ~-0.62 over 9 steps, noisy. Side-channel buckets: win ~0.17, lose ~0.58, illegal ~0.21, unparsed ~0.03; think length pinned at cap (~6700 chars). No clear trend yet at lr 1e-6 — expected this early.
- Read illegal samples: 604/604 are OCCUPIED-cell moves, zero off-board. Model loses track of stones mid-CoT (truncation compounds it); e.g. W plays onto W's own stone while analyzing its neighborhood. Cleanly learnable (-1 signal).
- Entropy steady 0.30. No degenerate hacks visible in CoT tails so far — reasoning is board-analysis-shaped throughout.
- Next checkpoints: step 25 (save + val). Plan: after pilot, merge ckpt 25/50/75/100 -> HF, eval_checkpoint each, read 1 full trajectory per ckpt, then decide Phase 3 config.

## 2026-08-05 09:55 — Step-25 val: slope confirmed, legality-led

- Val (fixed 277-pos set, t0.6): reward -0.675 -> -0.632; win 0.162 -> 0.184; illegal 0.238 -> 0.162; unparsed 0.047 -> 0.011.
- Side channel: illegal 0.24 -> 0.15 across buckets; win noisy-slightly-up. Think length creeping UP (~6600 -> 6900 chars against the 2160-token cap ceiling... chars vs tokens: still pinned at cap; the char-drift may be vocab/density change, not length). Watch.
- Phase-2 gate (nonzero slope, no degenerate hack) trending PASS. Checkpoint 25 saved.

## 2026-08-05 11:40 — Step-50 val: win-rate slope now real

- Val trajectory (t0.6, fixed set): reward -0.675 / -0.632 / -0.523; win 0.162 / 0.184 / 0.238; illegal 0.238 / 0.162 / 0.134; unparsed 0.047 / 0.011 / 0.007 at steps 0/25/50.
- Interpretation: first ~25 steps consumed the format/legality gradient; steps 25-50 show genuine move-quality learning. Entropy stable ~0.31-0.32 (no collapse). No degenerate hacks in read samples.
- C2 note from step-40 CoT reading: "bridge" already used in generic-English sense pre-existing; track semantic narrowing, not token novelty.
- Phase-2 gate: PASS (pending no surprises by step 100).

## 2026-08-05 13:30 — Step-75 val: acceleration

- Win: 0.162 / 0.184 / 0.238 / 0.314 at steps 0/25/50/75. Illegal 0.10, unparsed 0.004, reward -0.372. Entropy 0.33 stable.
- Phase-3 checkpoint policy decided (21GB/full ckpt, 84GB free): cadence 50, ckpt_janitor.sh merges to HF (3.4GB) + prunes shards, keeps 2 newest full for resume. Main run = EXTEND this pilot (same config/arm A, resume from step 100) to ~750 steps; beta=0 control ~225 steps fresh.

## 2026-08-05 12:30 — PILOT COMPLETE + first C3 result

Pilot final: val win 0.394 @k=1 t0.6 (0.162 baseline), curve 0.162/0.184/0.238/0.314/0.394, illegal 0.238->0.090, unparsed 0.047->0. Exit 0, 4 ckpts, all merged to HF.

**C3 early falsifier (150 val positions, k=4, t0.6):**
- base:    no-think win 0.195 (legal 0.652) | forced-close CoT win ~0.16-0.19
- ckpt100: no-think win 0.338 (legal 0.740) | forced-close CoT win 0.317 (legal 0.902)
- => CoT is STILL not load-bearing after 100 steps (no-think >= with-CoT). RL gains transferred fully to the no-CoT policy head, though training only ever ran in CoT mode. Concept learning is happening silently; the CoT rides along.
- Read step-100 CoTs: style unchanged from base (board re-parsing with occasional MISREADS, meandering candidates, truncation), winning moves often barely mentioned in the visible CoT before being played. Decorative-CoT hypothesis leading.
- natural_close_rate still 0.000 (prediction "rises >5% by step 100" at 25%: resolved NO).
- Grade pilot predictions: reward slope positive: YES (70% - hit). Legality >0.95: NO at step100 (0.90; 60% - miss, close). Win >0.45 by 100: NO (0.394 at k=1; 55% - miss, close). Natural close >5%: NO (25% - hit). CoT shortening: NO (30% - hit; length pinned at cap).

Phase 3 arm A = resume this run to 750 steps (same config; save_freq 50). Then beta=0 control ~225 steps.

## 2026-08-05 12:50 — C2 rough cut at step ~105 (side-channel, early-2000 vs late-2000 CoTs)

- No new coined terms. Enrichments are reweightings of existing English:
  1. Blocking/prevention talk up strongly ("blocking moves", "while preventing", "bottom while blocking", "needs to prevent") — semantically apt: win-preservation reward ~ blocking in hex. The clearest content-level drift so far.
  2. Candidate-cycling connectives up ("alternatively" chains) and visualization phrasing ("imagine that then").
  3. "game theory" x30 — spot-checked: vacuous transition filler ("let's think about the game theory"), not conceptual usage.
- Interim C2 verdict at 105 steps: consistent with the no-new-vocab null; CoT drift is stylistic/topical reweighting. Re-run properly (prompt-matched, tokenized, vs ref-perplexity) at Phase 4 with more steps elapsed.
- Phase 3 arm A resumed cleanly (re-val at 100: win 0.361 - k=1 noise around 0.394). Janitor loop + disk watchdog running. ETA step 750 ~ Aug 7 morning.

## 2026-08-05 15:15 — Ops: wandb + B2 backups (user request)

- Interrupted arm A at ~step 175, added wandb (project hex-rl-cot-deconfusion, run cyaib1sz), resumed from ckpt 150. User confirmed 1-2h compute loss is fine (<$0.50/h box).
- B2 backups via rclone to claude-code-backups/hex-rl-cot-deconfusion/: code, data, notes, logs, results, merged HF checkpoints. Recurring 2h sync loop running.
